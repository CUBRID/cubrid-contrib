## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to CUBRID.
When submitting change:
- **New proposal**: New proposal would be creating build helpers, templates, debugging tool etc. If you would like to suggest a new project, or if your change effects several files on existing project, Please create an [JIRA](http://jira.cubrid.org/projects/CBRD) issue.
- **Small changes on existing project**: For lightweight communication, try asking on [discussion channel](https://github.com/CUBRID/cubrid-contrib/discussions). This is a quick workaround allowing us to fix small bugs or to write/revise documentation to clarify how to use each project.
